# InferHub

**A self-hosted, Ollama-compatible inference mesh.**
Run the gateway where you have no GPU. Run worker nodes where you do.

## The problem

GPUs and servers rarely live in the same place. The machine that is always on — a small
VPS, a home server — usually has no GPU. The machines that *do* have a GPU — a desktop, a
gaming rig, a workstation — are often behind a home router and not reachable from outside.

InferHub closes that gap. A lightweight **coordinator** runs on the always-on, GPU-less
host and speaks a familiar Ollama-style API. The actual work runs on **nodes** that sit on
your GPU machines, reach *out* to the coordinator, and pull jobs down. No port forwarding,
no exposing your desktop to the internet.

In short: one stable address in front, a pool of GPUs behind it.

## How it works

```

- **Coordinator** — an ASP.NET Core service. It exposes an Ollama-compatible HTTP API,
  authenticates remote callers with a Bearer token, keeps track of which nodes are online
  and which models each one holds, and routes every request to a capable node.
- **Node** — a small .NET worker. It opens a persistent outbound connection to the
  coordinator (so it works fine behind NAT), reports which models it can serve, then
  receives prompts, runs them against its local inference backend, and streams the result
  back.
- **Pluggable backends** — each node runs an LLM backend behind a small abstraction
  (`IInferenceBackend`). The first backend is **Ollama**, driven by our own
  [OllamaClient](https://github.com/Dev-Art-Solutions/OllamaClient) library. The mesh
  isn't tied to it — other backends (vLLM, llama.cpp, OpenAI-compatible servers) can slot
  in later without touching the coordinator.

Because the API is Ollama-shaped, existing Ollama clients, scripts, and editor plugins can
point at the coordinator and keep working — they just reach a whole pool of GPUs instead
of one.

## Status

InferHub is being built in the open, one phase at a time. Each phase ends with a tagged
release. The current focus and the road ahead live in the roadmap below; the detailed,
day-by-day build briefs live in `/plan/` (kept out of version control).

| Phase | Theme | Version |
|------:|-------|---------|
| 1 | Foundation & coordinator skeleton (done) | `v0.1.0` |
| 2 | Node ↔ coordinator link (done) | `v0.2.0` |
| 3 | Model discovery (pluggable backend) | `v0.3.0` |
| 4 | Routing & blocking generation | `v0.4.0` |
| 5 | End-to-end streaming | `v0.5.0` |
| 6 | Authentication & security | `v0.6.0` |
| 7 | Conversations & smart routing | `v0.7.0` |
| 8 | Resilience, observability & 1.0 | `v1.0.0` |

## Quick start

> Coming together phase by phase. Once the early phases land, the flow will be:

```bash
# On the always-on host (no GPU needed)
dotnet run --project src/InferHub.Coordinator

# On each GPU machine (with Ollama already running locally)
dotnet run --project src/InferHub.Node

# From anywhere, talk to it like Ollama
curl http://your-coordinator:5080/api/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -d '{"model":"llama3","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

## Built with

- [.NET 10](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (C#)
- [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/) + [SignalR](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/signalr/) for the coordinator and the node link
- A pluggable node backend (`IInferenceBackend`); the first one is **Ollama**, via
  [OllamaClient](https://github.com/Dev-Art-Solutions/OllamaClient)
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) on each node (for the Ollama backend)
